Abstract
 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory uses a rotating shadowband radiometer to measure solar radiance in the Oak Ridge National Lab. Data files are available from September 2007 to November 2019. The station has the ability to measure global horizontal radiation (W/m2), diffuse horizontal irradiance, also known as diffuse sky radiation (W/m2), direct normal irradiance (W/m2), and direct normal (bird estimate) using an algorithm that produces estimates of clear sky direct beam.  Each irradiance factor can be paired with meteorological components such as air temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), wind speed(m/s), wind direction (degrees from N), estimated barometric pressure (mBar), precipitation and accumulated precipitation (mm), temperature of the CR800 datalogger panel (℃), and the voltage charge of the battery that powers the datalogger and the shadowband (V). The data set from the available dates can be selected in 1-minute intervals, hourly intervals, or daily statistics.
